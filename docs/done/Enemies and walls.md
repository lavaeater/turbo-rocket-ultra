# Enemies and walls
Enemies should not get stuck on walls, enemies should try to find good routes to wherever they are going. A good idea would be a debug-view for the Behavior Tree - both perhaps being able to see what node is active etc, but also see where they enemy is headed. We could implement that as having a debug flag on nodes or the systems or something, so that it displays onscreen what the intentions of the enemy is.
