# Different places
Slightly harder, but not that hard. Every player has to go to some specific place on the map, could be a cool time to implement split-screen so that the player that is the farthest from the center of the group is split off, temporarily, to enable better controls. This would be so fucking cool I piss my pants. 
## Notes
This card is actually done and the stuff that is left below should be made into separate features, if even kept around
- [x] Enemy Kill Counter
- [x] Faster and Faster Spawning
- [x] Area Hold Timer (when is area not holding? Distance)
- [x] Area Hold Timer in Map Def
