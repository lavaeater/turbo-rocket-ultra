### Enemy AI II
Make the enemy handle walls and obstacles better. It shouldn't be that hard. In fact, we could make a goddamned A* graph of the entire map space that is passable terrain and that would in fact solve the problem. Or at least make a graph of points that makes sure the enemy does not walk into walls, it could be done. Hey, every section could have a "get valid points"-method. Also, make enemies more aggressive towards players, now they seem to ignore them quite a bit, perhaps sensors are turned off or something.
