# New Fact System
Whatwhat, why?

I want to rewrite it to make the system easier to understand, easier to use, easier to expand.

Facts should be basically what they are, but criteria should be more versatile. 

First off, make facts into sealed classes, it is the bomb. They never have type erasure, for instance.
