# Enemy Evolution
Exactly what it sounds like. How can we vary the enemies,
how can we evolve their behavior?
We need to explore MORE behaviors and try to make the BT even more complex and cool and stuff.

Also, add attack anims (there are silly ones in the spritesheet that can be used for now)

## Behavior ideas
* Enemies that after detecting players run and find more enemies to sort of "set the alarm"
* Storing different levels of aggression
