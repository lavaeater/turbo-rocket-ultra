# Transitions
I tried this using an addon that already exists. However, it uses nested framebuffers and a separate SpriteBatch (instead of generic batch) so I couldn't make myself bother. Will try something else instead. Maybe I will simply clone his project and update the code and rewrite it in Kotlin.
To make this happen we need to fork this and rewrite it using the generic spritebatch or something like that.
