# New Look and Feel
The C64 aesthetic is nice - but the colors and available layouts are dull and boring and ugly.

We should spend 30 minutes on scouring available skins in that project to see what we can find.

Maybe all we need is a nice little font.
That was arduous and boring and gave very little back to me. Perhaps I should simply try to change the font in the skin for the c64 one I use, and or switch some colors around. This stuff is harder than most things.
