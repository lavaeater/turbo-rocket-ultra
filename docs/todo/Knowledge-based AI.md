So, the state is in components. But it doesn't have to be. Some state, or perhaps *"knowledge"* is stored in the FactsOfTheWorld database. In there are facts that pertain to a certain agent (previously known as an enemy).

This could be what spots the agent has visited, what players it has seen, etc. It is quite possible to create BehaviorTree Tasks that use Criteria to do what they want to do. In fact, Stories might be connected to Agents to affect their behavior. 

**My God.** 

Sometimes I feel like I'm a genius, but I don't think that's necessarily true. 

This would simply mean that a particular Task would, when succeeded or failed, simply set some fact or another to some value. 

This could be used, to great effect, for guard tasks.
