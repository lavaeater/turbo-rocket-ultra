# Vehicles
This is like the holy grail of features. This is what all this started with, the entire game. So, players enter vehicles, control different parts of the vehicle etc. This could be combined with the concept "moving level" where the players are on a platform that is moving through some kind of river / level somehow.

Remember, this is a lot easier with the new Intents feature.
