# Intent-based Weapon Select
Use Intent systems and components to handle selections of weapons and such.
This ties in nicely with the new [[Guns as Entities]]-feature, this will sort of be the last step towards completion of gun handling. After this is done, we can create some more [[New Gun Sprites]].

How do we do this? Like we did build mode, of course. Would be nice to tie it all together with the stuff from the [[Nicer Setup UI]] where I simply remade some classes for players etc. But that can come later
