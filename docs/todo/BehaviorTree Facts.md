# Behavior Tree Facts
I want to add a mechanism where the different components and behavior tree things set different facts in the FactsOfTheWorld-mechanism. This would mean that we might set or unset counters for enemies entering rooms, detecting enemies, changing behavior trees and stuff like that.
This can then in turn make it possible to have a sound system that reacts to different facts being set - thus triggering sounds, events whatever, using Stories.
