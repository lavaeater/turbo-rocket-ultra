# Nicer Setup UI
So, just make a better setup screen, add icons, texts etc that explains what should happen etc.
What should it contain? What does it contain? What does it lack?
## What it lacks
It totally lacks information about what's going on. The game has a stolen splash screen, which is bad, but the setup screen should have...
- [ ] A five-lane player selection-thing
- [ ] A logo in the background
- [ ] Sensible information shown
- [ ] Info on what buttons to press
