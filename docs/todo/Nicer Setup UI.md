# Nicer Setup UI
The todo-point A logo in the background was transformed into a [[A Nice Logo]]

So, just make a better setup screen, add icons, texts etc that explains what should happen etc.
What should it contain? What does it contain? What does it lack?
## What it lacks
It totally lacks information about what's going on. The game has a stolen splash screen, which is bad, but the setup screen should have...
- [x] A five-lane player selection-thing
- [x] Detect controllers, perhaps all the time, during setup screen
- [x] Sensible information shown
- [x] Info on what buttons to press
