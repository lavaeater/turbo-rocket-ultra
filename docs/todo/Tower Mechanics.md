## Tower Mechanics
This is not a "new" feature per se, rather it is expanding upon the [[Build Towers]] feature, which is done insofar as one can now build towers, but what can the towers do for you? Nothing, I say!
So this is like a one-stop-shop for AI for towers (there is already some stuff done for that), health for towers, perhaps, how many towers can a player build etc?

This one is a great candidate to do now.
