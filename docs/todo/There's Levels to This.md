# There's Levels to This
We have levels, we have stories, we have rules, we have facts.

But facts are not saved, not rules either, and I'm not entirely entirely sure about the "levels as pictures"-stuff either.

We should probably move ALL of this into a mapdefinition that can be serialized - and therefore loaded and unloaded, edited in a regular text editor. It **would** be cool if we could make the actual map into a simple textformat thing.
## Example map def
Space character is empty? 
Or if it is empty, replace it with a star or dot or something?
