# Release Candidate
What needs to work for the game to be *"releasable"*?

First, we try to run it, all parts of it, from a release. When we discover an issue, we note it and then if we cannot progress in testing of the game, we fix it.

## TODO
- [ ] Changing map / level doesn't work, for some reason
