# Player Graphics
This is what categorizes as a FUN task, it should be FUN! But it also requires lots of work, mainly in making art happen. Making heads, bodies, hair, stuff like that, and enabling generating characters and sprite sheets from that. Lots of work, but there could be great payoffs in the end.
