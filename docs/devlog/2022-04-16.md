# Easter
The todo-list below is almost unusable. It is like random stuff that has come up during my latest work-episode, but this is not at all what I want to do, these are things that could be done at any time in the future. I think the top one, build handling for gamepads, might actually be done already, but I'm not sure at all. 

Where do I keep track of the things I want to do, and in what order? That's what trello is for, but perhaps there exists some kind of plugin that could help me with this. 
Anyways, I thought I'd list off some things that have come up and could be of use in the future. Always trying to keep features *tiny* - fixing the build mechanics was super fast when I figured out how I wanted it.
## What's next?
I need to figure out what feature to implement next.

## New ideas
[[Tower Mechanics]]
[[Thought Bubbles]]
[[Facts for Fun]]
[[Hierarchical Facts]]
[[Facts for Gameplay]]
[[Guns as Entities]]

## Todo
- [ ] Implement build handling for gamepads
- [ ] change guns using Action thingie
- [ ] Make context action depend on the Intent Stuff
- [ ] Enable / Disable doing certain things depending on current player mode - which means we need a switch statement for modes, they need to be exclusive
