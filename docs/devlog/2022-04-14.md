# Thursday
So, I worked on [[Build Towers]] yesterday and came a fair bit a long. The greatest thing I figured out was something inspired from a short thread on reddit regarding ECS in a RogueLike game, but just a few sentences can be enough to inspire a breakthrough when coding.
The issue I was having was having the player go from "regular mode" into "build mode". Now, this could of course be implemented with a finite state machine, but I'm not entirely sure about that being a great way to do it. FSMs tend to get cluttered after a while, I'm quite often struggling with them.
The other issue was that the implementation I did select didn't render due to my rendering pipeline (or whatever you call it) had some FX added to it using a framebuffer. Well, that requires everything to be drawn inside of a capture block, so to speak, to then have FX applied and then displayed.
Before the changes, I had a BuildSystem that sort of checked if the player was in build mode or not and if the player was, we rendered markers and stuff. Well, that wouldn't do, at all, would it?
So I was inspired to do something called Intents. Basically, when the player presses **B** for Build, an IntentComponent is added to the player (I put all intents in one component for now, to limit the amount of systems I had to implement) where the "intent" is **IntendsTo.ToggleBuildMode**. This is then picked up by the IntentSystem that adds a BuildModeComponent to the player entity **and also** creates a completely separate entity that is the cursor for building stuff. 
Putting the cursor in its own entity meant that it would be rendered in the "normal" pipeline, so FX would work, and using some nice little Kotlin features I could also have:
- Easy updating of the selected sprite 
- updating of the position of the built item to adhere to the grid on the map
I'm super happy with all of this and I think what it first and foremost shows was that the principle for ECS is that it should be easy to write new features and functionality.
