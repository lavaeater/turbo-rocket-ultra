How do we "evolve behavior", as we write about in [[Enemy Evolution]]? 

The key to evolution in this context is find a fitness function and a way to evolve generations.

## Fitness functions
What is the fitness of a cave-dwelling zombie? 
It could probably be several factors. We want the zombies to be moving about, so perhaps exploring the map is one. Another could be surviving for a long time. Finding the player could be another, causing damage to the player also one. We have to be careful, we want the enemies to act as a horde, in this case, meaning that we should promote behavior that is good for all enemies.
The bosses are different though.
## Evolution
To perform evolution, we could imagine a base behavior tree. The tree could randomly add things to any branch, change any guard, change from sequence to selector, for instance. But most important of all, we would need to be able to serialize the trees so we could evolve and save them over time.
## Enemy movement
Right now the enemies move inside the behavior of movement, or rather, the behavior sets their direction of movement, I think. However, I think we should try to generalize the system, somehow.

For instance, we don't want enemies running to alert someone to get stuck, nor do we want enemies that run towards the player to get stuck. So they should always be running towards a section of map, unless they are close to a point or target. Basically, they should use A* to navigate.

## Quicker nav
By the way, to make A* quicker, we can cache the paths created as from-to-pairs and save them. We could even pre-calc them for the entire maps sections. 

## Todo
- [x] Cache navigations
- [ ] Generalize movement
- [ ] Serialize BTs
- [ ] Enemy pickups
- [ ] Write a fitness functions
- [ ] Evolve Behavior Trees
