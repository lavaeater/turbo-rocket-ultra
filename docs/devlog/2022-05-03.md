# Tuesday
Yesterday was a day filled to the brim with activity. I finalized a map editor that can save files, change the name of the file, the only thing it lacks is undo, for now. 

And I realized I cannot serialize the stories, because they contain code. What they could contain instead is keys to code to run, then they would suddenly become runnable (you are a genius, mate). But that will be for a different day. 

I added this to the serialization card.

I think I will mix together the [[Enemy Evolution]] and Enemy Aggression cards into just the one, and perhaps work some on that. Having cool enemies is key to a good game.

However, I will try not to work so much on the game today, I have work to do.
