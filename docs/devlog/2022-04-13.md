# Wednesday 13th of April
So, what I did yesterday was working on implementing some kind of *intent* functionality.
Basically this is supposed to work lite this:
1. The player presses a button, say for build
2. This adds the "IntendsToBuild" in the Intent-component
3. The Intents-system tries to switch to build-mode (not possible if the user already is in build-mode)

I found the weak spot. The intent is not "intendsToBuild", the intent should be ToggleBuild - because that is what it is!
Remove the extra intent, replace it.
## Todo
- [x] Refactor build intents.
