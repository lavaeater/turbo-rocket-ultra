# Devlog Wednesday
## Start
So, I've been working on the [[Nicer Setup UI]] feature and basically got stuck immediately. The thing is that I have previously been developing my own framework for creating UIs in a "simpler" way than using Scene2d as is, out of the box.

Well, those efforts weren't necessarily in vain, they were perhaps just misguided. Basically, parts of it is really cool, and re-usable, which is that I have created data-bound versions of scene2d widgets, such as databound labels and databound texture widgets - but now I am trying to create databound collection widgets and my brain is basically exploding.
The problem might be that I don't really need databound collection widgets and that I have lost track of what I wanted to do, which is "a nicer setup UI". So to get back on track, I will try to focus on that and *if* I need a databinding mechanism, I might create it.
## End
So, the day ended with a slightly nicer UI. This is great!
The slightly nicer UI works better, I learned some stuff about Scene2d and everything is just hunky-dory. 
## Todo
- [x] Try to create some aspect of the nicer setup UI
- [x] Make game startable from this state
- [ ] Make a rule that works on all "reached way point"-facts
