# Thursday
So, it would appear that I have done all of the things below. Nice!
I don't think I will handle actual item todo's here, more perhaps some other things. 
Today I finished the [[Enemies and walls]] thing, making it less likely that enemies get stuck on obstacles and also enabling a debug view for the behavior tree and components. That has to be updated, however, it shows waay to much right now.
It could simply include a filter / list of components to check. Anyways, that's for another day, now we merge and destroy that branch!
## Todo
- [x] Make a function to update position of UI components
- [x] What to display in the BT component
