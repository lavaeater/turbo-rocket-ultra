So, [[2022-04-27|yesterday]] I started work on the [[New Fact System]].

It went swimmingly, is probably not perfect, but it basically has all the features of the old system, i.e, different types of facts, support for Lists, rules that match facts - or several facts thanks to the wildcard syntax for fact keys, etc, etc.

Next step is to implement ALL story-related stuff with this new system to put it through the test.
## Todo
- [ ] Make a rule that works on all "reached way point"-facts
- [ ] Make a rule that works on all "reached way point"-facts
