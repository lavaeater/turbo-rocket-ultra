# Thursday
So, what's on the docket for today? I'm currently working on [[Enemy Evolution]], [[AI Refinement]] and just came up with the idea of [[Knowledge-based AI]] as well. But right now we're focusing on refactoring the AI system, moving away from using components to dictate behavior, however, we still want to use components for *guard tasks*, since they fit that scenario super well.
So, it will be a long, hard, walk towards having all the logic that currently are in systems moved into Leaf Tasks. It's not all bad, we are figuring stuff out and that's fine. The difference will be that we won't be moving enemies using a System (maybe), instead we will use the TimeStep data to move them inside leaf tasks, and that might actually be fine.

Or, we simply use the Leaf tasks that set the properties used by the movement system.
## Todo
- [ ] Select Map on Setup Screen
- [ ] Test behavior on ONE Enemy with seeking
- [ ] Enable seek debug, perhaps?
- [x] Evolve Behavior Trees
- [ ] Generalize movement
- [ ] Enemy pickups
