## Failures and dead-ends
Sometimes the best course of action is to abandon ship and swim to shore. That's what I decided to do this day. The case wasn't super strong, it was kinda vague, but there is case there. Basically, the card [[BehaviorTree Facts]] won't be done now (facts are being set in it, though), but we will probably evolve the facts into something else, later.

Lets call that [[New Facts]].

We might end up doing that sooner rather than later, but for now we should probably try to make something small happen.



There will be a change in how we handle criteria and their keys. Instead of allowing fuzzy keys that match multiple facts, I shall implement at kind of programmatic key that will take perhaps two functions, one that returns the list of items to iterate over and one that creates a key for each item.

This, however, makes it necessary to handle this on a story / rule level, where that particular rule or story has to handle the fact that it is a list-based story somehow. 

No, perhaps it is some kind of dynamic story? Dynamic rules, dynamic criteria?

Again, the entire point of all of this is that this system, the facts system, should be independent of everything else. So facts stay key->value based, because that makes it separate and re-usable in many more contexts.

But what I want to do is some kind of story "acting on collections". 

Because we want it to play, in this case, some audio when *any* zombie completes a waypoint. And as I could see, it meant that we had 120 facts about waypoints in the system at any given time. now, a 120 loops isn't that much.

But perhaps it should generate a 120 keys... but the facts have to be true, all of them, at any given time, to be executed. So it is best to make it into a entity-based, or collection based, thing.

I think I might want to abandon this in favor of the more broader feature **Simplify facts and rules and stories** because right now I am kind of stuck.

The basic system always assumed there was one and only one fact. 

Facts could probably be simplified to an insane level by using sealed classes and so on.

## Todo
- [ ] Make a rule that works on all "reached way point"-facts
