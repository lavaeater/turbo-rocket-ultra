There will be a change in how we handle criteria and their keys. Instead of allowing fuzzy keys that match multiple facts, I shall implement at kind of programmatic key that will take perhaps two functions, one that returns the list of items to iterate over and one that creates a key for each item.

This, however, makes it necessary to handle this on a story / rule level, where that particular rule or story has to handle the fact that it is a list-based story somehow. 

No, perhaps it is some kind of dynamic story? Dynamic rules, dynamic criteria?

## Todo
- [ ] Make a rule that works on all "reached way point"-facts
