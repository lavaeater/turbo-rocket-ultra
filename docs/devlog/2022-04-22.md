What is the case for [[BehaviorTree Facts]]?

That particular feature didn't come to fruition as I thought it would be, not yet at least. What's the point of it?

Here's the point, described in [[Facts of The World]].

The point is simply that we want to be able to track tons of stuff in a more or less generic way from wherever in the game code.

What we see below is a cool case.

## Todo
- [ ] Make ambling system set some flag if an enemy reaches a way point
- [ ] Make a rule that works on all "reached way point"-facts
- [ ] Make a story that plays a random zombie sound effect when zombies reach waypoints
