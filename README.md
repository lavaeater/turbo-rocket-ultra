# Turbo Rockets Ultra
## What's this?
This is not an homage to the Amiga game [Turbo Raketti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboraketti). However, at some point, I think it was actually supposed to. I look through my old dev logs and there are notes about vehicle combat. What the hell?
No, this is a twin stick shooter where you shoot zombies and pick up loot. It is a hobby project aimed to explore and discover and enjoy game development using [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) - an open source, multi-platform, java based framework. I code in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), which is an excellent programming language.
## Features of the game
I try to think of things I want to have in the game and then I try to implement them the best way I can. The ambition is for it to be *easy* to write new functionality and to find the least complex way to do it. Or maybe not the least complex, but adding more functionality shouldn't be completely painful.
So, the game has, in no particular order:
* maps as files
* ai
* loot
* dynamic lighting
