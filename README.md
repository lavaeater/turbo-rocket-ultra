# Turbo Rockets Ultra
## What's this?
This is not an homage to the Amiga game [Turbo Raketti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboraketti). However, at some point, I think it was actually supposed to. I look through my old dev logs and there are notes about vehicle combat. What the hell?
No, this is a twin stick shooter where you shoot zombies and pick up loot. It is a hobby project aimed to explore and discover and enjoy game development using [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) - an open source, multi-platform, java based framework. I code in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), which is an excellent programming language.
