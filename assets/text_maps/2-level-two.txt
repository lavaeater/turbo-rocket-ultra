Go Down One Level
start
If Project Phoenix
is to succeed, we need
to cleanse the tunnels of the
Zombie-mutant hordes that thrive
down there in the darkness. When
done, then finally the
FAMILIES can move from the Silos
into the Tunnels and our society
will rise

LIKE THE PHOENIX!

success
Yes, it is hard work.
No, it isn't pleasant, killing, butchering.
But always think of the greater good,
think of the F A M I L I E S that will
have living space thanks to your sacrifice.

fail
A nation is only as strong as its people.
We must hope this is not a testament to our
nations and peoples strength, because
then we are truly fucked.
