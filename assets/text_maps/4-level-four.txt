4-level-four

Never look back,
never look towards the light.
You are not IN the darkness
You ARE the darkness - the terror
To everyone that lives beneath
us.

Nothing matters anymore.
Right

Wrong

It's all the same, in the end.

All that matters is that you press on,
always downwards

Never give up the dream
The dream of a future
free of varmint
