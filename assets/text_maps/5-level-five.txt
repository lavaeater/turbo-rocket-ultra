name
5-level-five            
start
Is there no end to the killing
and the murder?
Will you ever be able to wash out the blood?
Will friends and family be able to rekindle
what trace of humanity is still left in you?

Or will they be able to tell - that you have

changed?

success
Is there glory in this?
No.
Is there triumph to be had?
No.
All you hear are the whispers of
the slave in your ear:
"you are merely mortal"

fail
I cannot look upon you with my eyes.
Leave. Never come back.
